# What are Neural Networks?

It is a machine learning program, or model that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain 
by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weight options and arrive at conclusions

Neural Networks includes... 

1. Inputs: Food images like Ramen or Pasta
2. Numerical Encoding: Before data gets used with a neural network, it needs to be turned into numbers
3. Neural Network: Choose the appropriate neural network for your problem where it learns representation (patterns, features, weights)
4. Representation outputs: i.e. features, weight matrices, weight tensors, learned representation
5. Readable outputs: where a human can understand

## Anatomy of Neural Networks
1. Input layer: data goes in like units / neurons = 2
2. Hidden Layer(s): it learns patters in data like units / neurons = 3
3. Output layer: outputs learned representation or prediction probabilities like units / neurons = 1

Each layer is usually combination of Linear (straight line) and or Linear (not straight line) functions

Note: "patterns' is an arbitrary term, they may be refer to as 'embedding', 'weights', 'feature representation', 'feature vectors', but all refering to similar things

## Types of Learning
1. Supervised Learning: Data and Labels
2. Unsupervised & Self-Supervised Learning: No labels, Cats and Dogs photos
3. Transfer Learning: It takes the patents of a model that has learned and transfer to another model, so it gets a head start
4. Reinformcement Learning: Agent, Actions -> Rewards -> observations
