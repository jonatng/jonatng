# What is a Tensor

A torch.Tensor is a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single data type.

| Name          | What is it?                      | Number of dimensions                                                                   | Lower or upper |
| :-----------: | :-----------:                    | :-----------:                                                                          | :-----------:  |
| scalar        | a single number                  | 0                                                                                      | Lower (a)      |
| vector        | a number with direction          | 1                                                                                      | Lower (y)      |
| matrix        | a 2-dimensional array of numbers | 2                                                                                      | Upper (Q)      |
| tensor        | a n-dimensional array of numbers | can be any number, a 0-dimension tensor is a scalar, a 1-dimension tensor is a vector  | Upper (X)      |


The shape and dimensions of what's inside a Tensor will dictate what it actually is
* scalar is a single number                   | 0 number of dimensions
* vector is a number with direction           | 1 number of dimensions
* matrix is 2 dimensional array of numbers    | 2 number of dimensions
* tensor is an n-dimensional array of numbers | can be any number

How do you determine the amount of dimensions a Tensor has? use the square bracket counting trick
