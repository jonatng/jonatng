# What are the PyTorch essential neural network building modules?

| PyTorch Module | What does it do? |
|-|-|
| torch.nn | Contains all of the building blocks for computational graphs (essentially a series of computations executed in a particular way). |
| torch.nn.Module | The base for all neural network modules, all the building blocks for neural network are subclasses. If you're building a neural network in PyTorch, your models should subclass nn.Module requires a forward() method be implemented. |
| torch.optim | Contains various optimization algorithms (these tell the model parameters stored in nn.Parameter how to best change to improve gradient descent and in turn reduce the loss |
| torch.utils.data.Dataset | Represents a map between key (label) and sample (features) pairs of your data. Such as images and their associated labels.  |
| torch.utils.data.DataLoader | Creates a Python iterable over a torch dataset (allows you to interate over your data). |
