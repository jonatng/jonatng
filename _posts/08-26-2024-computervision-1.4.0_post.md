# What is Computer Vision

It is is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputsâ€”and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues.

Common use cases:
* Autonomous vehicles
* Image generation
* Traffic flow analysis
* Pedestrian detection
* Cancer detection
* Quality control
* Crop monitoring
...And many more

When it comes to training for computer vision, a typical PyTorch workflow may look something like this

As with other ML models, computer vision requires large amounts of images and/or videos to train on. The more data, the more accurate the output will be. Stay Curious!
